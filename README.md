# English Learning Platform – Content-Driven LMS

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **content-agnostic English learning web application** built as a **technical platform** for English professors and educational institutions.

The goal is to provide a **robust, scalable learning management system (LMS)** where:
- **Professors create and manage teaching content**
- **Students consume content and practice learning**
- **The developer delivers the technology, not the pedagogy**

This separation ensures scalability, flexibility, and professional responsibility boundaries.

## 🎯 Vision

To empower English teachers with a modern digital platform that allows them to:
- Create lessons without technical knowledge
- Manage students and track progress
- Deliver personalized learning experiences

The platform itself does **not** provide teaching content — it provides the **tools**.
